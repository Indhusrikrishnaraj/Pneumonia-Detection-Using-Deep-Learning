# Pneumonia-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning
This project focuses on detecting pneumonia in chest X-ray images using deep learning techniques. The model is trained to distinguish between normal and pneumonia-infected lungs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with TensorFlow/Keras. The goal is to assist medical professionals in making faster and more accurate diagnoses.
